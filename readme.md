# Rust Command-Line Utilities Project

This Rust project aims to create command-line utilities that mimic some basic functionalities of popular Unix utilities. The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on experience in learning Rust by building simple yet useful tools. Rewriting existing tools in Rust can be an excellent way to grasp the language's syntax, data structures, and standard library.

## Project Structure

The project will consist of the following utilities:

- `echo`: Repeats input
- `cat`: Concatenates files
- `ls`: Lists directories
- `find`: Locates files or directories
- `grep`: Matches text in files

## Dependencies

Apart from the standard Rust libraries, no additional crates or dependencies are required for these utilities.
